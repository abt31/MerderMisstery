General Gameplay Flow:
	1) Generate People
	2) Interaction Simulation
	3) Murder Simulation
	4) Player interaction
	5) "Solve the murder" portion
	6) End of play

Part 1: Generate people is specified mostly by the AI team document

Part 2: Interaction Simulation
	* Event Trees
		- Relationship (Romantic)
		- Relationship (Friendly)
		- Conflict
	* NPC's are allowed to interact with whoever they choose to in the place they are in
		- So two NPC's in the church may interact, but an NPC in the church may not interact with an NPC in the Market
	* Which event tree an NPC enters will be determined by their relationship and memories
	* The conflict tree is technically an option from anywhere on either of the relationship graphs
	* NPC's will attempt to enter certain trees that contain their goals
	* Murder simulation is tripped when one NPC's relationship variable (to another NPC) drops below their murderiness variable

Part 3: Murder Simulation
	1) Force Murderer and Vic into separate rooms
	2) Continue simulating until Murderer and Vic enter same room
		-Note that the Vic will move around erratically, while the Murderer will continue to follow their routine as usual
	3) Stop simulation
	4) Pick a weapon from one of the rooms murderer was in
	5) Generate event that someone noticed the weapon was gone
	6) Begin play

Part 4: Player Interaction
	* Top down, speak to NPC's in town
	* May talk to judge in town hall when you're ready to convict the perp

Part 5: Solve the Murder
	* Interact with a jury, present evidence
	* Eventually rest your case
	* If the Jury is convinced, sentence the person
	* If not, they go free

Part 6: End of play
	* If you convicted the right person, quick animation of the murder victim's ghost smiling and dissapearing, finally at peace
	* Else, make it clear they can't rest yet because their murderer is not behind bars
