* Personality: dictionary of values
* Mood: a scalar
* Goal: an Event object
* Memory: a list of Event objects
* Relationships: a list of scalars

* Traits:
   * Lust
   * Disloyalty
   * Greed
   * Wrath

Mood:
* Simply a  number, will be used to make choices in dialogue / event trees

Memory:
* A list of events that an NPC can run through when making decisions about which events to pick


Relationships:
* A list of scalar values, each of which determines how one NPC feels about another
* Related to the murderiness scalar as described below


Murderiness:
* if an NPC has a relationship below the murderiness factor with another, than NPC will trigger the murder event and kickstart the mystery


Event:

* Dialogues will take the form of “event trees”
* Actions can also be represented in this way (X steals from Y)
* Which event tree / event an NPC picks at any given time will be a determination of their personality, mood, relationships, etc.
   * The exact trees will be specified in the ISD document
