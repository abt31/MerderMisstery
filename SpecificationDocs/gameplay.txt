Interaction Specification Doc, as decided on by the ISD / AI team:
	- Conversation will take place across 4 templated questions
	1) Who do you think killed 'the victim'
		-NPC will look through their memories and make a guess if they have a certainty above a certain value
		-Certainty will be affected by finding memories that involved the victim and a negative interaction with another NPC
		-Obviously no NPC will accuse themselves or the victim
		-If the NPC makes a pick, will relate the three most relevant incidences
	2) What is your last memory of the victim?
		-Fairly straightforward
		-Will relate any memory, even if it was not a direct interaction
	3) How does "x" feel about "y"?
		-Will use a certainty threshold similar to 1
		-May relate a particular memory (if it is particularly relevant, e.g. they recently fought, got married, etc)
	4) Where were you at 'time t'?
		-Not particularly useful if you have the schedules memorized, but can help paint a picture of who was where, when
